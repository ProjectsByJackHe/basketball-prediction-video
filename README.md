# Simple UI dashboard for collecting pose data as JSON

## TLDR;

This repo uses the ML5 PoseNet (tensorflow.js) model to label poses from a video file. You can tweak the canvas size and other model attributes to suit your video and use-case.


Afterwards, you can set intervals of time while watching your video in real time to save the labelled data as JSON.
